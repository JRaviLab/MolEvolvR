\usage{
GenContextNetwork(
  prot,
  domains_of_interest,
  column = "GenContext",
  cutoff = 40,
  layout = "grid",
  directed = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{prot}{A data frame that contains the column 'GenContext'.}

\item{domains_of_interest}{Character vector of domains of interest.}

\item{column}{Name of column containing Genomic Context from which nodes and edges are generated.}

\item{cutoff}{Integer. Only use GenContexts that occur at or above the cutoff percentage for total count}

\item{layout}{Character. Layout type to be used for the network. Options are:
\itemize{\item "grid" \item "circle" \item "random" \item "auto" \item "nice"}}

\item{directed}{Is the network directed?}
}
\description{
This function creates a Genomic Context network from the 'GenContext' column.
}
\details{
A network of Genomic Context is returned.
