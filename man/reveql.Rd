\title{reveql: Reverse Equalities in Genomic Context}
\usage{
reveql(prot)
}
\arguments{
\item{prot}{\link{vector} A vector of genomic context strings to be processed.}
}
\value{
\link{vector} A vector of the same length as the input, where each genomic
element is annotated with either a forward ("->") or reverse ("<-") direction,
depending on its position relative to the "=" symbols.
}
\description{
This function processes the genomic context strings (GenContext) and reverses
directional signs based on the presence of an equal sign ("=").
}
\examples{
# Example input: Genomic context with directional symbols and an asterisk
genomic_context <- c("A", "B", "*", "C", "D", "=", "E", "F")
reveql(genomic_context)

# Output: "A->", "B->", "*", "<-C", "<-D", "=", "E->", "F->"
}
