\usage{
generate_all_aln2fa(
  aln_path = here("data/rawdata_aln/"),
  fa_outpath = here("data/alns/"),
  lin_file = here("data/rawdata_tsv/all_semiclean.txt"),

  fa_outpath = here("data/alns/"),
  lin_file = here("data/rawdata_tsv/all_semiclean.txt"),
  reduced = F
)
}
\arguments{
\item{aln_path}{Character. Path to alignment files.
Default is 'here("data/rawdata_aln/")'}

\item{fa_outpath}{Character. Path to the written fasta file.
Default is 'here("data/alns/")'.}

\item{lin_file}{Character. Path to file. Master protein file with AccNum & lineages.
Default is 'here("data/rawdata_tsv/all_semiclean.txt")'}

\item{reduced}{Boolean. If TRUE, the fasta file will contain only one sequence per lineage.
Default is 'FALSE'.}

\details{
The alignment files would need two columns separated by spaces: 1. AccNum and 2. alignment. The protein homolog file should have AccNum, Species, Lineages.
