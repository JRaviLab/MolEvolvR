\usage{
gc_undirected_network(
  prot,
  column = "GenContext",
  domains_of_interest,
  cutoff_type = "Lineage",
  cutoff = 1,
  layout = "grid"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{prot}{A data frame that contains the column 'DomArch'.}

\item{column}{Name of column containing Domain architecture from which nodes and edges are generated.}

\item{cutoff_type}{Character. Used to determine how data should be filtered. Either
\itemize{\item "Lineage" to filter domains based off how many lineages the Domain architecture appears in
\item "Total Count" to filter off the total amount of times a domain architecture occurs }}

\item{cutoff}{Integer. Only use domains that occur at or above the cutoff for total counts if cutoff_type is "Total Count".
Only use domains that appear in cutoff or greater lineages if cutoff_type is Lineage.}

\item{layout}{Character. Layout type to be used for the network. Options are:
\itemize{\item "grid" \item "circle" \item "random" \item "auto"}}
}
\description{
This function creates a domain network from the 'DomArch' column.
}
\details{
A network of domains is returned based on shared domain architectures.

\examples{
