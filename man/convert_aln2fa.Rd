\arguments{
\item{aln_file}{Character. Path to file. Input tab-delimited file +
alignment file accnum & alignment.
Default is 'pspa_snf7.aln'}

\item{lin_file}{Character. Path to file. Protein file with accession +
number to lineage mapping.
Default is 'pspa.txt'}

\item{fa_outpath}{Character. Path to the written fasta file.
Default is 'NULL'}

\item{reduced}{Boolean. If TRUE, the fasta file will contain only one sequence per lineage.
Default is 'FALSE'}
