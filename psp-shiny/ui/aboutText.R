abstract <- "The phage shock protein (Psp) stress-response system protects bacteria
from envelope stress and stabilizes the cell membrane. Recent work from our group
suggests that the psp systems have evolved independently in distinct Gram-positive
and Gram-negative bacterial clades to effect similar stress response functions.
Despite the prevalence of the key effector, PspA, and the functional Psp system,
the various genomic contexts of Psp proteins, as well as their evolution across
the kingdoms of life, have not yet been characterized. We have developed a computational
pipeline for comparative genomics and protein sequence-structure-function analyses
to identify sequence homologs, phyletic patterns, domain architectures, gene neighborhoods,
and evolution of the candidates across the tree of life. This integrative pipeline
enabled us to make several new discoveries, including the truly universal nature
of PspA and the ancestry of the PspA/Snf7 dating all the way back to the Last Universal
Common Ancestor. Using contextual information from conserved gene neighborhoods
and their domain architectures, we delineated the phyletic patterns of all the
Psp members. Next, we systematically identified all possible ‘flavors’ and genomic
neighborhoods of the Psp systems. Finally, we traced their evolution, leading us
to several interesting findings of their occurrence and co-migration that together
point to the functions and roles of Psp in stress-response systems that are often
lineage-specific. Conservation of the Psp systems across bacterial phyla emphasizes
the established importance of this stress response system in prokaryotes, while the
modularity in various lineages is indicative of adaptation to bacteria-specific
cell-envelope structures, lifestyles, and adaptation strategies."
