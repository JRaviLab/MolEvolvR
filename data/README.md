## Final data files

### Processed data files
for each protein the shiny table
format: `xyz.txt`

### Summary by lineage for GC & DA
GC: Genomic context <br>
DA: Domain architecture <br>

Lineage-wise summary counts for each of the protein's homologs have been generated for DAs and GCs.

`xyz-da_lin_counts.txt` OR `xyz-gc_lin_counts.txt`
